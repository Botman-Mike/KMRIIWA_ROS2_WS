Please update our Java TCP client so that every outgoing message is framed exactly like the Python side:

Append \r\n to the payload string.
Compute its UTF-8 byte length, format it as a zero-padded 10-digit ASCII string.
Send [length][space][payload+CRLF] over the socket.
For example:

Also, implement your receiver to do a sliding-window search for that 10-digit header+space, read exactly N bytes, verify it ends with CRLF, and if not drop one byte and re-sync.‚Äù
